# 🌍 World Population Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes **world population data** using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. It performs data loading, visualization, and statistical analysis to extract meaningful insights from global population trends.

This notebook was developed as a part of the **Data Science Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File used**: `worldpopulationdata.csv`
- The dataset includes:
  - Country-wise population data
  - Yearly trends
  - Growth patterns and distributions

---

## 🔍 Key Tasks Performed

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Reading the CSV file using `pandas.read_csv`.
   - Previewing the first few records using `df.head()`.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Checking for null values and duplicates.
   - Renaming or dropping unnecessary columns (if any).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing population trends using bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps.
   - Identifying the most and least populated countries.
   - Analyzing continent-level population statistics.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, max, min).
   - Correlation analysis between various numerical features.

---

## 📊 Sample Visuals

- Population growth by country.
- Top 10 countries with the highest population.
- Correlation heatmap between features.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Real-world data preprocessing and analysis.
- Mastery of `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` for data visualization.
- Gained experience in identifying trends and presenting insights from global data.
